# Finger Exercise:
'''
Assume you are given a positive integer variable named N. Write a piece of Python code that finds the cube root of N.
The code prints the cube root if N is a perfect cube or it prints error if N is not a perfect cube. 
Hint: use a loop that increments a counterâ€”you decide when the counter should stop.
